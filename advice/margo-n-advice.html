                <h4>Accountability Matters</h4>
                <p>When you begin to work through the curriculum, you may be tempted to hold yourself accountable to a certain work pace. If you're like me, you'll soon find that this is a mistake.</p>

                <p>You can't know how long it will take you to work through each lesson. Additionally, you want learning, not timing, to be your highest value.</p>

                <p>You can solve this problem by committing to a certain amount of time each week. In this way, if you put in the time, you are a success...no matter how quickly you move through the material!</p>

                <p>In the end, you will have truly learned the material at the right pace for YOU. Good luck!</p>
